      <h2>Who is Osrey?????</h2>
      <p> Hello there. I am <strong>Osrey: The Bear King</strong>. I know what you are think. <em>“How did such a small animal become the king of the bears?”</em> Well, my <em>hoomans</em> give the name not knowing what it would mean someday. It was the combination of their two names, Oscar and Elrey. Oso meaning "Bear" and Rey meaning "King". As I grew into the magnificent beast you see before you I would prove the worth of my name. From the talks with the Great Hounds of Barking, to my days of training in the Cat Doom, to the great battle with the evil wizard known as ………<a href="evil_wizard.html"><strong><em>VACCOOM</em></strong></a>; I would raise to power and took my rightful place as king of the land.
